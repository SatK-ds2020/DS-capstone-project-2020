    <p style='color:darkblue'> 1. This is a NextWord Prediction App and is a part of Coursera Data Science Specialization-Capstone Project offered by John Hopkins University.
                                            This web app is inspired by Swiftkey, a predictive keyboard on smart phones.</p>
     <p style='color:darkblue'> 2. This app uses a text-prediction model based on N-gram frequency with 'stupid backoff algorithm'.
                                            The text you entered in the inputbox, it's  last four words will be used to predict the next word, for example, 
                                            if the sentence is <strong>'it happened for the first time'</strong> the words <strong>'for the first time'</strong> will be used 
                                            to predict next words.</p>
     <p style='color:darkblue'> 3. This prediction model uses 1-5 ngrams as dictionary to search,with a precalculated back-off score from highest to lowest frequency.
                                              The probability of next word is depends on the backoff score which is calculated by dividing the counts of matches found in ngram/n-1 gram 
                                              multiplied by **backoff factor= 0.4** with each droping n-grams</p>
                                       - First the search started with 5-grams model to match last 4 words of User Input and the most likely next word is predicted with highest score.<br>
                                              - If no suitable match is found in the 5-gram, the model search 'back's off' to a 4-gram, i.e. using the last three words, from the user provided phrase,
                                                to predict the next best match.<br>
                                              - If no 4-gram match is found, the model 'back's off' to a 3-gram, i.e. using the last two words from the user provided phrase, to predict a suitable match.<br>
                                              - If no bigram word is found, the model default 'back's off' to the highest frequency unigram word available.<br><br>
                                       
     <p style='color:darkblue'> 4. The general strategy for Building this predicitive language model is as followed:-</p>
                                       - Creating the large corpus with sampling and pooling the blogs, news, and twitter data with stop words.<br>
                                              - Cleaning the corpus and Building n-grams frequency tables, up to 5-grams. These frequency tables serve as frequency
                                                dictionaries for the predictive model to search for the match.<br>
                                              - Probability of a term is modeled based on the Markov chain assumption that the occurrence of a term is dependent on the preceding terms.<br>
                                              - Remove sparse terms, threshold is determined.<br>
                                              - Use a('backoff strategy', href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katz%27s_back-off_model') to predict so that if the
                                                probability a quad-gram is very low, use tri-gram to predict, and so on.<br><br>
